__During this homework use all commands from the presentation!__


1. Read about best practices for writing a commit message.
2. Add any ~3 commits to the master branch
3. Make a new branch ( ex. dev )  from master
4. Add any ~2 commits to the new branch ( ex. dev )
5. Create a new branch(ex. alpha)  from the dev
6. Add ~1 commit  to  a new branch(ex. alpha)
7. Use cherry-pick to relocate this new commit from the new branch (ex. alpha) to master 
8. Make an investigation about the cherry-pick command:
    * find and use cherry-pick command that changes the commit message when relocating the commit 
    * find and use cherry-pick command that relocates the commit without making any commit, and all changes are in the index
9. Add any ~3 commits to the master branch and to the dev branch 
10. Rebase commits from the dev branch to master and see what happens.
11. Create a new branch from the master (ex. feature) 
12. Add any ~3 commits to the feature branch
13. Checkout to the master branch and make ~1 commit 
14. Merge feature branch to master
15. Make an investigation about merge Strategies in Git
16. Create a branch(ex: before_interactive_rebase ) and make some commits. Create a new branch from previously and open interactive rebase (You have to create two branches that mentors can see how you use interactive rebase):
    * Squash's last ~3-5 commits
    * Change some commit message
    * Remove any commit
17. Make conflicts when using cherry-pick command, rebase, merge and solve them.
18. Investigate about .gitignore and add it to repo.
